# GenAI4SE Assignment: Code Embedding and Visualization

**Objective**
To observe visualization of the embeddings of 10 code snippets sampled from the task Code Clone Detection benchmark from CodeXGlue using CodeBert model and TSNE technique. 

**Requirements**
The dependencies are listed out in the requirements.txt attached in the zip file

**Code**
AN ipynb file is attached in the zip file that can be run directly by importing into Google Colab. The code implementation was done on Google Colab.

**Experimentation**
The following task was experimented with two CodeBert models - CodeBert-base and CodeBERTa-small-v1 with perplexity values of 5 and 7 for each. The observations for each case have been noted in the next section.

**Observations and Visualizations**
